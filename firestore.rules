/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the e-commerce application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict admin-only access model for managing products and categories. Only users with a designated admin role can create, update, or delete data in these collections. Product and category data is publicly readable to all users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product information. Publicly readable.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores category information. Publicly readable.
 * - /roles_admin/{uid}: Indicates admin privileges; presence of a document for a user grants admin rights.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access: All users (authenticated or not) can read products and categories.
 * - Admin-only write access: All write operations on /products and /categories are restricted to admin users.
 * - Authorization Independence: Admin status is determined solely by the existence of a document in /roles_admin/{uid}, avoiding costly `get()` calls.
